## Overview

The Practitioner Main Form is divided into different tabs and sections. Every Tab & Section Name reflects the information on that form/section to help a User navigate through creating a Practitioner. Some fields are required to save the Practitioner in the system i.e. First Name, while other fields can be added to the system later on. Any time a field is required a red star will display next to the field. See below.
