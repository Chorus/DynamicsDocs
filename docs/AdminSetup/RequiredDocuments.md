**Coming Soon!**

Required documents can be set up on a [payer] to represent which documents that payer requires for you to have on file for the patient (diagnostics, referrals, evaluations, etc.).

The required documents for a payer will automatically be created on the patient's [opportunity](../CRM/Opportunity.md/#create-a-patient-opportunity) so that you can track when the documents were received, as well as when they expire.

You can add documents to a patient contact at any point. The documents show on the Medical Info tab of the patient profile.

You can also view expiring and expired patient documents on the Patient Documents Dashboard.
