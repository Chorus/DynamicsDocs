**Coming Soon!**

Definitions are used throughout the system to give your organization flexibility to customize options across various fields and workflows.

You can review existing definitions and add new definitions from the Definitions view on the setup area of the sitemenu. 

## Referral Category Definitions
Referral Category definitions can be created to allow you to group [referral accounts](../AdminSetup/Account.md/#referral-accounts) into categories (daycares, schools, care management associations, etc.).

This will allow you to report around the amount of opportunities brought in from specific referral account categories.

## Marketing Source Definitions
Marketing Source definitions track the different sources where patient/practitioners can find your organization (website, facebook ad, linked in post, etc.).

You can also set for [leads](../CRM/Leads.md) to come in automatically set to a specific marketing source.

## Document Definitions
Document definitions can be created to allow you to set up [required patient documents](../AdminSetup/RequiredDocuments.md) per payer.

## Practitioner Role Definitions

- *Name*
- *Access Role* - determine what level of access a provider with this role will have in Note (BCBA = edit care plan access, Behavior Technician = read-only care plan access).
