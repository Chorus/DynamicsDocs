# Healthcare Services

A healthcare service is a service you will be providing to your clients. This is where you’ll be setting up the friendly titles to use for various insurance service codes, so that everyone can refer to and understand service terms in the same way. 
- *Name* – title for the service
- *Service Type* – select an appropriate service type from the list of options.
:::note
The healthcare service type defines the session's behavior in the Note app: 
  - Initial Assessment: Assessment report can be generated from the session
  - Follow-Up Assessment: Assessment report can be generated from the session
  - Direct Treatment: Data collection on care plan targets and the Direct Treatment session note template are available on the session.
  - Non-Billable: A session note is not required on non-billable sessions, and the session will not be included on claims (only on payroll).
:::
- *Description* – optional description for the service
