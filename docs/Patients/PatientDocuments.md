# Patient Documents
**Coming Soon!**
A list of the documents that are required for you to have on file for the patient (diagnostics, referrals, evaluations, etc.) can be added on the Medical Info tab of the patient's profile. 

Some documents are created automatically during the [opportunity](../CRM/Opportunity.md/#create-a-patient-opportunity) workflow if there are required documents set up on the payer of the patient's coverage. [Learn about Required Patient Documents on Payers](../AdminSetup/Account.md/#required-patient-documents).

- *Patient* - the patient this document is regarding.
- *Document* - select the document that needs to be obtained / was obtained. [Learn how to set up document definitions](../AdminSetup/Definitions.md/#document-definitions).
- *Received Date*  - enter the date the document was received.
- *Expiration Date* - enter the date the document expires or needs to be requested again.
