# Calendar

The Calendar tab displays a calendar with the patient's schedule.   

The calendar displays all the Sessions scheduled for this patient. You can view the calendar by day, week or month. When looking at the calendar, the session displays the status of the session, the service that will be provided, and the practitioner's name. The session's color corresponds to the color of the session status in Note.

Upon clicking on the session in the calendar, a popout displays the exact time and duration of the session scheduled. 

By clicking on 'more details' on the popout, you will be navigated to the [encounter service](../Scheduling/SingleEncounters.md/#encounter-services). By clicking on 'delete' on the popout, the session will be deleted.

## Set Patient Availability

The Patient Availability tab displays the Patient Availability calendar. This calendar displays the hours the Patient works/can be serviced, the hours they do not work/cannot be serviced and any time off. The Patient Availability calendar has the same 3 views as the Scheduling calendar. 

To add Patient availability to the schedule, click 'Set Patient Availability'. 

This will open the Patient Availability calendar in a new tab. (This tab is hidden until a User clicks 'Set Patient Availability'.)

Patient Availability is used for the [Schedule Assistance](../Scheduling/ScheduleAssistance.md) tool. Any time that is set as a Patient 'does not work', displays as unavailable in the tool. This helps a Scheduler schedule a session between a Patient and a Practitioner.
