# Encounters 
Encounters are the sessions between patients and practitioners and other related contacts (family training). 

The Encounters tab has 2 sub grids. 1 sub grid lists all the recurring encounters related to this Patient and the other sub grid lists all the single or occurring encounters related to this Patient.

**Recurring Encounters** - encounters that are set to repeat on a recurring schedule, either daily, weekly, or monthly. Each recurring encounter consists of multiple encounter occurrences – which are the individual encounters.
- The default view for the Recurring Encounters sub-grid is ‘Current Recurring Encounters’ and it displays all recurring encounters that still have encounter occurrences scheduled in the future. 
- [Read more about Recurring Encounters](/docs/Encounters/RecurringEncounters.md).

**Single Encounters** – encounters that are scheduled on a one-off basis, and encounter occurrences that are part of a recurring encounter. 
- The default view for the Single Encounters sub-grid is ‘Upcoming Encounters’ and it displays scheduled individual encounters (single encounters or encounter occurrences). 
- [Read more about Single Encounters](/docs/Encounters/SingleEncounters.md).
