# Cancel Encounter Services

To cancel a session, open the encounter service you'd like to cancel, click 'Cancel', and choose from cancellation reasons, including:
- Provider Cancellation
- Learner Absence
- Learner Unavailable
- Mandate Completed This Month
- School Closure
- School Event/Trip
- Holiday

In a group encounter, you can choose to cancel an individual encounter service under the encounter, while leaving the parent encounter and the rest of its encounter services scheduled. You can also cancel the parent encounter to cancel all encounter services it contains.

When an encounter service is canceled, its related charge item and payroll item are deactivated, (unless the payroll item is already in a closed payroll period).

## Deactivate Encounter Services

You can deactivate encounter services when a session was scheduled in error.

:::note
If observations were already collected on the session in the Note app, the encounter service cannot be deactivated. Instead, the practitioner should first [remove the inaccurate observations](https://notedocs.chorus.cloud/docs/DataCollection/EditDataAfterSession) in Note. 

Scheduler Admins have permissions to override this rule.

4.  All related records (encounter, encounter services, encounter participants) will be deactivated.

An encounter service can also be deactivated by opening the encounter service and clicking 'Deactivate' on the form's ribbon.

## Deactivate Recurring Encounter Services

Recurring encounter services are parents to a set of related encounter services that were generated based on the recurrence pattern selected.

The recurring parent cannot be deactivated. Instead, deactivate the encounter service occurrences by following the steps below.
