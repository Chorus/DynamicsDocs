# Recurring Encounter

Recurring Encounters are encounters that are set to repeat on a recurring schedule, either daily, weekly, or monthly. Each recurring encounter consists of multiple encounter occurrences – which are the individual encounters.

## Create a Recurring Encounter 
Recurring Encounters can be created from [Schedule Assistance](../Scheduling/ScheduleAssistance.md), or by clicking on the New Recurring Encounter button on any Encounters grid.

Creating a Recurring Encounter follows the same workflow as creating a [Single Encounter](../Scheduling/SingleEncounters.md/#CreateSingleEncounter), with the following additions:

- When selecting the start date, enter the start date and time for the first encounter, the rest of the encounter occurrences will be based on the same start time as scheduled on this encounter.
- Set up a recurrence pattern, and review and generate occurences.

### Set Recurrence Pattern
- *Repeat* – select the frequency of the recurrence – daily, weekly, monthly, etc.
- *Every* – Enter the frequency at which the recurrence should repeat – Every 1 week, every 2 weeks, every 3 days, etc.
- *Days* - (when Repeat = "Weekly", or "Monthly– Same Week") – the day/s in the week or months to repeat this recurrence.
- *Week* - (when Repeat = "Monthly– Same Week") – the number of weeks into the month to repeat this recurrence – First, Second, Third, Fourth, Last.
- *Day of Month* - (when Repeat = "Monthly– Same Day") – the day of the month to repeat this recurrence.
- *End* – select how to end this recurrence – by an end date, or a number of occurrences.
    - *End Date* (when End is "By End Date") – the day on which the recurrence should stop repeating.
    - *Total Occurrences* (when end is "By Number of Occurrences") – the total number of occurrences to generate according to this recurrence pattern.
