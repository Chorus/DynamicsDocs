# Payments

Click "Payments" on the sitemap of the RCM app to view all payments that have come in from payers to your clearinghouse.

A payment can also include a Payment Adjustment (can be positive or negative amount) - when the payer wants to make an adjustment that is not related to a specific remit, or when it is for a remit not included in this payment (a past remit for example).
