# Remits

Remits, or claim payments, represent electronic remittance advice (ERA) that contain information regarding the claim payment  - what was paid per claim line, what adjustments the payer made on each claim line (what they did not pay) along with CARC codes for each adjustment, which explains what the adjustment is about (e.g., "CO-45" means according to the contract, the payer agreed to pay only x amount, so the amount paid was adjusted).

A remit can also include a Remit Adjustment (can be positive or negative amount) - when the payer wants to make an adjustment to a few lines in the claim/remit.
