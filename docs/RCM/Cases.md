# Cases
Create a case on a claim to track historical information regarding resubmissions or outreach to payers regarding denials or outstanding balances.
1. On a claim, go to the Cases tab.
2. Click 'New Case' to create a new case. Fill in the relevant detail on the case, including subject, CARC codes, account, and patient.
3. Save the case.

To add an existing case to multiple claims, either:

- Open the case. In the Bulk Case Claims section, click 'Add Existing Claim'. Choose the claim to link to this case.

or:
- On each claim you'd like to link to this case, go to the Cases tab. Click 'Add Existing Case'. Choose the case to link to the this claim.

## Case Dashboards

Reference the Case Insights dashboard to easily understand how many open cases your organization has with each payer for each case subject, how much is outstanding on claims with open cases, and how many cases are canceled/resolved/in progress.

Drill down by case owner or carc code to get even deeper insights.

The Tier 1 dashboard gives you quick access to active cases, and resolved cases, draft emails, and open activities (tasks, appointments, etc.).
