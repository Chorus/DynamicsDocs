## Case Stages

Cases have 3 active stages:

1. New
2. In Progress
3. Awaiting Payment


- The **New** stage is for filling in the initial details of the case and assigning it to a team member to take next steps on. 
- The **In Progress** stage is for contacting the relevant parties (payer, patient, internal team members, etc.) about the outstanding balance for the claim(s) and why it was denied (investigating a duplicate charge, contacting a payer about timely filing exceptions, etc.).
- The **Awaiting Payment** stage is to track claims for which action was taken and a response is expected from the payer. Use the *Follow Up By* field to ensure regular follow-ups are performed.

Click 'Resolve Case' at any point to mark a claim as resolved. Click 'Cancel Case' at any point to mark a claim as canceled.

:::note
Only one active case can be tracked against a claim at any point. To open a new case against a claim, resolve or cancel the existing case.

## Case Dashboards

Reference the Case Insights dashboard to easily understand how many open cases your organization has with each payer for each case subject, how much is outstanding on claims with open cases, and how many cases are canceled/resolved/in progress.

Drill down by case owner or CARC code to get even deeper insights.

The Tier 1 dashboard gives you quick access to active cases, and resolved cases, draft emails, and open activities (tasks, appointments, etc.).
