## Utilization

The Utilization Dashboard gives you a streamlined way to track the utilized and remaining hours for each authorization service, empowering your organization to create schedules that maximize utilization.

The report is divided into 3 tabs:

1. **Total** (default): this tab display the percent utilized for all authorization services, no matter how they are authorized. For example, a service authorized as 10 hours per week would still show on this tab, and the percent utilized will be based on the hours utilized out of 10 hours * the amount of weeks in the authorization period.
2. **Weekly**: this tab gives you a focused view of utilization for every individual week, for authorization services authorized per week. This empowers you to flag weeks with low utilizations, and make scheduling adjustments as needed.
3. **Monthly**: this tab gives you a focused view of utilization for every individual month, for authorization services authorized per week. This empowers you to flag weeks with low utilizations, and make scheduling adjustments as needed.

:::note Filter Tips
- Use the Business Unit filter when focusing on a specific department of your organization, or the service filter when reviewing utilization for a specific service.
- When focusing on utilization rates for past weeks, consider filtering by just submitted sessions, in case providers forgot to cancel some sessions that never occurred. You can also adjust the global date filter to show authorization services for the last 6 months.
- When focusing on the utilization rates of upcoming schedules, clear the session status filter so all future sessions are included and adjust the global date filter to show authorization services for the next 6 months.
