The **BT Data Per Day** report allows easy monitoring of practitioner performance. Filter by practitioner or patient to ensure the amount of data collection per day is meeting your organization's standards.

The **Care Plans** report is an organized view of each patient's complete care plan. Filter by practitioner, patient, skill acquisition domain/subdomain, or target status and review target configurations, instructions, intervention techniques, etc. for full visibility to your organization's care plans.

## Utilization

The Utilization Dashboard gives you a streamlined way to track the utilized and remaining hours for each authorization service, empowering your organization to create schedules that maximize utilization.

The report is divided into 3 tabs:

1. **Total** (default): this tab displays the percent utilized for all authorization services, no matter how they are authorized. For example, a service authorized as 10 hours per week would still show on this tab, and the percent utilized will be based on the hours utilized out of 10 hours * the amount of weeks in the authorization period.
2. **Weekly**: this tab gives you a focused view of utilization for every individual week, for authorization services authorized per week. This empowers you to flag weeks with low utilizations, and make scheduling adjustments as needed.
3. **Monthly**: this tab gives you a focused view of utilization for every individual month, for authorization services authorized per month. This empowers you to flag months with low utilizations, and make scheduling adjustments as needed.

:::note Filter Tips
- Use the Business Unit filter when focusing on a specific department of your organization, or the service filter when reviewing utilization for a specific service.
- Use the authorization filter to narrow down your results to just current authorizations, or just future authorizations.
- When focusing on the utilization rates of upcoming schedules, or to include sessions that were not submitted yet, clear the session status filter so all future sessions are included.
