Our apps are built on Dynamics 365, which enables us to customize a secure and stable software around your orgnaization's needs, with full integration to the Microsoft Power Platform (Power Apps, Power BI, Microsoft Office, etc.).

Our system is built around the FHIR entities. An entity is a type of record. Example: The Contact Entity is a type of record that stores information related to people (patients, practitioners, etc.)

**Views** can be configured for any entity in the system to display results of all records that meet your filter and sort criteria. [Read more about Views](ViewsDashboards).

**Forms** are available for all any entity in the system to create records. 

The entity's **fields** display on the form. There are multiple types of fields:
1. Text
2. Date/Time
3. Lookup to another record (e.g., the Practioner field on the Authorization) 
    - These fields are blue and can be clicked on to open the related record (Ctrl + Click to open the record in a new tab).
4. Optionset

Records of one entity can be related to another record of another entity. Forms in Autism Care include tabs for easy access to related entities (e.g., the Care Team Assignment form has a tab for Related Encounters). You can also access Related records by clicking "Related" on any form (e.g., the Related tab on the Fee Schedule Item form shows related Modifiers and Claim Items).
