# Views

## Create a View
Selecting any entity on the sitemap will open up that entity's *Main Grid* which is a view of that entity's records. All views can be filtered and configured according to your needs.

To create a view that suits your needs, open an existing view. You can add to and edit the existing view until it displays the information you are ooking for.

 ### Update Colums
 
 1.  Click the "Edit Columns" button on the right hand side of the page

-   To add additional Columns to the view, click "Add Columns" on the pop out form.
