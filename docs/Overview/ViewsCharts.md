# Views
Views of common entities can be accessed easily on the [site menu](/docs/#site-menu). Selecting any entity on the site menu will open that entity's *Main Grid*. All views can be filtered and sorted according to your needs.

The system also includes views of relevant records on individual forms, called *subgrids*. Subgrids usually offer multiple views (e.g., 'Upcoming Encounters' and 'All Encounters'). You can switch between views using the View Selector.

To create a view that suits your needs, open an existing view. You can add to and edit the existing view until it displays the information you are looking for.

### Update Columns
 
1.  Click the 'Edit Columns' on the right-hand side of the page.
