title: Emails on the Timeline
---

Emails back and forth with practitioners can easily get lost in your inbox. In AutismCare, you can send emails straight from the contact’s timeline, and track received emails there too. Keep all of your communications in one place to streamline your outreach.

Reach out to your manager if you’d like to connect your Outlook account to AutismCare.
