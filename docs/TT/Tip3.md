# Wildcard Search

Need to find a contact's record but can't remember how to spell their name? No problem! Use a * to help you out:

- ABC* will show you results where 'ABC' is the first three characters.
- *ABC will show you results where 'ABC' is found anywhere in the name.

This trick also works for searching contacts by phone numbers and emails in AutismCare!
