title: Manage Tasks Efficiently
---

Did you know you can manage your to-dos directly in AutismCare?

Create tasks right from any timeline — whether it’s intake steps on an opportunity, follow-ups with parents on a contact, or QA tasks during authorization workflows.
Easily keep track using the task view, where you can see your own tasks, everyone’s tasks, and quickly filter by due date.
Need a reminder? The Assistant highlights what’s due today so nothing slips through the cracks.
Plus, you can sync AutismCare tasks with Microsoft To Do — check it off in To Do, and it’s automatically marked complete in AutismCare.

Want to set up task syncing or the Assistant? Just ask your account manager!
