title: Pin Your Favorite View
---

Do you frequently access a specific view? Did you create a view for an entity thatâ€™s not on the site menu that youâ€™d like to come back to?

Hereâ€™s how you can pin your favorite views for easy access:
1. Expand the Recent section on the site menu.
2. Identify the view you accessed recently that youâ€™d like to pin for easy future access. Click the pin ðŸ“Œ icon.
3. Expand the Pinned section on the site menu to access your pinned views at any time!
