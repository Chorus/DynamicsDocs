Reviewing patients, sessions, or claims one after another? Record set navigation makes it easy!

Instead of closing each record and returning to the view to see the next one, simply click the List icon next to the back arrow to seamlessly navigate through records.

Need to focus on a specific tab within a record? With record set navigation, as you move through records in your list, you will stay on the same tab for each record.
