# RCM 4.0.4 - July 2025

- Enhanced [Case Management](../RCM/Cases.md) Workflow: We’ve upgraded the Case Management experience to make it easier to track and manage claim-related follow-ups and recover payments.
    - Case Creation for Groups of Claims – You can now create a single case across multiple claims directly from any claims view. On the case form or case views, you can see the sum of the outstanding (or cost share outstanding) from all of the claims on the case.
    - Case Stages – Track progress with new case stages: New, In Progress, and Awaiting Payment.
    - Case Views – Quickly filter and manage cases with new views: Open Cases, My Open Cases, Cases In Progress, Cases Awaiting Payment, and Resolved Cases.
    - Claim Views with Case details - Manage open balance claims efficiently with the case subject, status, and follow-up by date on your claims view.
    - Only one active case can be tracked per claim at a time to ensure focused follow-up. Use the Follow Up By field and timeline tracking for efficient resolution.

- Create Custom [Write-Off](../RCM/RCMworkflow.md/#write-offs) Reasons: Make your write-off reporting work for you. You can now create and manage your own Write-Off Reasons, giving you greater flexibility to track, categorize, and report on financial adjustments in ways that reflect your internal processes.

- Add Claim Notes During Corrections: When correcting a claim, you can now add explanatory notes that will appear in Box 19 of the CMS-1500 Claim Form.

- Charge items are not created for non-billable sessions.

- RCM data is now segregated by [business unit](../AdminSetup/BusinessUnit.md), so you can control which users see which financial data. When generating claims, choose which business units you’d like to generate claims for.

- [Billing Export](../Billing/BillingSetup.md/#billing-export) includes charge items from the selected date range based on the patient’s time zone.
