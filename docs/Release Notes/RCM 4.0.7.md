# Claims/RCM 4.0.7 - December 2025

- Notes can be added to [charge items](../Billing/ChargePeriods.md) (e.g. explaining why charge items were placed on hold). Notes show on the On Hold and Awaiting Resubmission charge item views, and can also be added as a column on personal views.
- Place of Service is set on all charge items, not just when set based on an insurance plan billing requirement. Place of Service will always be set in the [billing export](../Billing/BillingSetup.md/#billing-export).
- You can now add the [case](../RCM/Cases.md) description, subject, and follow up by date to any [claim line view](../Billing/ClaimItems.md/#claim-line-views)! You'll see those columns on the “Open Balance- Case Details” Claim Line view, and they can also be added to personal views.
- You can now view the total expected, paid, and billable start/end on [cases](../RCM/Cases.md) for all of the related claims. Those columns are also available on case views.
