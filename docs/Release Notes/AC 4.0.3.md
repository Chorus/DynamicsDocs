# Autism Care 4.0.3 - July 2025

- [Copy Recurring Encounters](../Scheduling/RecurringEncounters.md/#copy-a-recurring-encounter)! Managing frequent schedule changes just got easier! Instead of manually ending and recreating recurring encounters, you can now copy them in seconds.

    1. Update the end date on the recurring encounter that is no longer relevant- all occurrences after the end will be removed.
    2. Click Copy Encounter to create a copy of the recurrence template.
    3. Make your adjustments on the copy and click generate!

    This is perfect for teams who need flexibility without the extra clicks.

- üóìÔ∏è Simplified Recurring Encounter Setup: We‚Äôve updated the recurring encounter form to streamline how session details are entered.
Now, the timing of each session (start time and end time) is set on the first stage of creating a recurring encounter, while the start and end dates of the recurrence pattern are defined on the next stage.
This makes viewing and editing recurring encounters more intuitive and organized.

- Smarter Edits to Authorization Service Dates: Making updates to authorizations just became more intuitive. When you change the start or end date on an authorization, you‚Äôll now be prompted to automatically apply the same change to all related services.

- [Utilization Dashboard](../Overview/Dashboards.md/#utilization) Enhancements:
    - Access Utilization straight from the Patient‚Äôs Profile!
    - Filter by past, future, or current authorizations.
    - Narrow results by specific weeks on the Weekly Utilization tab.
    - Filter by Case Manager to see your patients.
    - See services with 0% utilization included in your results for quick action

- [Session Note Export](../Patients/Overview.md/#export-patient-session-notes) Enhancements:
    - Want to mention a practitioner‚Äôs qualifications next to their signature on a session note? Simply turn on ‚ÄúShow on Session Notes‚Äù on the qualification definition, and that qualification will be listed next to any Practitioner who has it.
    - Units Rendered are based on the session‚Äôs charge item (rather than claim) for increased accuracy.

- Other Enhancements:
    - View the timestamp of session submission directly on the encounter service form.
    - Set or update the Case Manager directly on a Patient Profile.
    - Jump straight to a related contact from within a patient profile.
