# Practitioner Contracts

Create a practitioner contract for every practitioner to set how they will be paid (hourly vs. salary, rate, etc.).

Multiple contracts can be created for a single practitioner. For example, if you are awarding a raise to a practitioner, you can create a new practitione contract and change the end date on the first contract. This allows you to track the history of the practitioner's contracts with your organization.

## Create a Practitioner Contract

Practitioner contracts can be created from the Payroll tab on a practitioner record (from either the Clinical Area or the Paroll area of the sitemap). Click 'New Practitioner Contract' on the Practitioner Contracts subgrid.

- *Practitioner* - the practitioner you are creating the contract for.
- *Start Date* - the start date of the contract.
- *End Date* - the end date of the contract (can be left blank).
- *Pay Type* - select either Hourly or Salary.
- *Salary Amount* - if the pay type is Salary, enter the salary amount.
- *Houly Pay Rate* - if the pay type is Hourly, enter the rate per hour.
- *Fee Schedule* - entering a [fee schedule](../AdminSetup/FeeSchedules.md/#payroll-fee-schedules) on a contract allows you to set specific overrides to the hourly rate, either for specific services, or specific patients.
